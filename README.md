# Derek's Mentoring Notes

This is a collection of examples that Derek and I worked though at various points throughout our mentorship program. Both week-1 and week-2 contain some exercises that we worked through in the first few weeks whilst we looked at how Derek approached problems and how he could improve his code. Week-10 was a few examples we worked though based on questions he had about async and multiprocessing in Python.
